# AdventOfCode2024
This is my log of the advent of code challenges I am participating in this year, This repository will have every day's input text and my code for them. In each folder will be 2 readmes, 1 is the challenge for the day, and the other is how my code works. I hope you enjoy and I challenge you to come up with better solutions than I have.

Happy Holidays
